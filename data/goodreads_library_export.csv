I was looking for an easy read as to be the first book I would read in German. For my level (A2->B1) this was perfect. Challenging enough that I would need to go to the dictionary regularly, but just at the right grammatical level I needed. The story itself is simple, daily life, relatable and touching as it deeps into single-parenthood, teenage struggles and mental health. Extremely relevant today as it describes ways through teenage emotions and conflicts that can follow up to adulthood. Overall it gives the message that everyone needs help sometimes navigating feelings and it is okay to seek for professional help too! I wish my writing confidence would let me write this review in German! ",,,1,,,0,,,,,
